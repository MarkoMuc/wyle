# TO-DO

## Ideas

1. `@` -> for commands.
    1. Add `tab` completion.
    2. Add reconfigurable `leading key`.
2. `<char>` -> for "copy output to clipboard"
    1. Leading key: `!`. -> Redirects output to clipboard.
3. Auto detect math.
    1. Leading key: `_`.
    2. Detect sin,cos, +, etc.
    3. HEX or BIN, `_` separators.
    4. Algebraic.
    5. GNU plot integration.
    6. Integrals, derivatives, limits.
    7. Calculator
4. Appearance:
    1. BAR.
    2. NO BAR / transparent.
    3. Animations.
5. If no window is in focus and typing (aka if desktop is in focus?) -> open wyle
6. Running something like `cat file` or `whereis konsole` should actually do something, as in show me the text or put it into the clipboard.
7. The same thing but for searching might actually be nice. I don't want to open a browser everytime I want to search something.
8. Access to Browser bookmarks.
9. Pressing the shortcut for opening the runner saves its current state.
10. How to detect, find and run various application, .desktop files, etc.
11. If a .desktop file is found (or what ever way applications can tell shortcuts/right click options/actions), then drop down the additional options (Should a key be used to open this submenu?)
12. First class support for man (drop down man).
13. A way for applications to give their commands to the runner and that can then be executed through the runner.
14. Application/Execution groups  (can be saved and loaded)
15. Use wl-copy.
16. Add predictive shadowing the previous or similar inputs.
17. Add history (this can be super when using the calculator).
