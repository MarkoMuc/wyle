# TO-DO

## Ideas

1. `@` -> for commands.
    1. Add `tab` completion.
    2. Add reconfigurable `leading key`.
2. `<char>` -> for "copy output to clipboard"
    1. Leading key: `!`. -> Redirects output to clipboard.
3. Auto detect math.
    1. Leading key: `_`.
    2. Detect sin,cos, +, etc.
    3. HEX or BIN, `_` separators.
    4. Algebraic.
    5. GNU plot integration.
    6. Integrals, derivatives, limits.
4. Appearance:
    1. BAR.
    2. NO BAR / transparent.
    3. Animations.
5. If no window is in focus and typing (aka if desktop is in focus?) -> open wyle
6. Running something like `cat file` or `whereis konsole` should actually do something, as in show me the text or put it into the clipboard.
7. The same thing but for searching might actually be nice. I don't want to open a browser everytime I want to search something.
8. Access to Browser bookmarks.
